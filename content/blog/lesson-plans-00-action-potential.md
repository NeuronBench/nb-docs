This lesson plan uses interactive neuron modeling to give students hands-on
experience with the core concepts behind the Hodgkin-Hukley action potential.


## Learning goals

 - Gain familiarity with the NeuronBench web app and configuration format.
 - Observe the impact of leak, <math display="inline">
   <mi>K</mi><sup>+</sup></math>, and <math display="inline">
   <mi>Na</mi><sup>+</sup></math> currents on a spiking neuron by
   selectively removing them.
 - Achieve greater intuition about the voltage gating and kinetics of ion
   channels, by experimentally modifying these properties and measuring their
   effects on the shape of the action potential.

## Requirements

 - Understanding of the Nernst and GHK equations.
 - Classroom knowledge of the role of <math display="inline">
   <mi>Na</mi><sup>+</sup></math>, <math display="inline">
   <mi>K</mi><sup>+</sup></math> and leak channels in determining
   the dynamics of an action potential in an idealized neuron segment.
 - Access to a Gmail account (for logging in to the NeuronBench app).


## Materials

The easiest way to administer this lesson is to distribute the link to the PDF
to your students. It contains instructions for getting started on NeuronBench.
If your students open the PDF in Firefox they will be able to answer questions
and draw diagrams directly on the PDF, save their changes and send them to you
for grading. The NeuronBench simulator itself works on all modern desktop
browsers.
