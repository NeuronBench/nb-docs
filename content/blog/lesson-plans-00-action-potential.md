This lesson plan uses interactive neuron modeling to enrich and enliven the
standard presentation of the Hodgkin-Hukley action potential.

Instruction on the generation of the action potential oftnen represents the
first time that nebulous, abstract neuroscience concepts begin to feel tangible
and grounded, as spikes become understanbable in terms of salt concentrations,
voltage gradients, and gated ion channels. But the usual presentation has room
for improvement; it can feel like a lot of received wisdom, a student may want
to know what the practical implications would be if a given ion channel had
different conductance, kinitecs or voltage deependence, and the entire treatment
can more quantitative than intuitive even after gaining confidence in the
equasions.

We will use interactive neuron models to bridge this gap by allowing students
to selectively remove ion channels or to tweak their properties, and instantly
measure the effect this has on an actively spiking neuron.

### Learning goals

 - Gain familiarity with the NeuronBench web app and configuration format.
 - Observe the impact of leak, K+, and Na+ currents on a spiking neuron by
   selectively removing them.
 - Achieve greater intuition about the voltage gating and kinetics of ion
   channels, by experimentally modifying these properties and measuring their
   effects on the shape of the action potential.

### Requirements

 - Understanding of the Nernst and GHK equations.
 - Classroom knowledge of the role of Na+, K+ and Leak channels in determining
   the dynamics of an action potential in an idealized neuron segment.
 - Access to a Gmail account (for logging in to the NeuronBench app).


## Materials

The easiest way to administer this lesson is to distribute the link to the PDF to your students. It contains instructions for getting started on NeuronBench. If your students open the link in Firefox they will be able to answer questions and draw diagrams directly on the PDF, save their changes and send them to you for grading.
